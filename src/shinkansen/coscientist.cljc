  "The framework's UI/UX kaizen loop — Generate → Reflect → Rank (Elo) →
  Evolve → Meta — with `shinkansen.audit` as the judge.

  Ported from the workspace's Co-Scientist pattern (keiei-arbor engine
  ADR-2606141500; isekai.ux ADR-0007; 90-docs/design-quality/coscientist.cljk)
  and made a FRAMEWORK module so every shinkansen consumer runs the same
  loop over its own emitted documents. The judge is deterministic: ranking
  is reproducible and never an LLM debate. The founding rule of that lineage
  holds here verbatim — an unmeasured metric is theater — which is why the
  loop refuses to converge on an audit that has unmeasured axes.

  Generate is the offline/heuristic path: one grounded hypothesis per
  aggregated finding, from a table that names WHO owns the fix
  (:consumer — the app's view / CSS; :deploy — the publish step; :framework
  — this repo) and its effort. An LLM Generate (proposing fixes beyond the
  audit's axes) is a follow-up; the heuristic path already demonstrates the
  full loop end-to-end and is what a gate can run.

  Pure .cljc, deterministic, no I/O: the caller renders documents, calls
  `kaizen-cycle`, and persists the iteration (append-only measurements)."
