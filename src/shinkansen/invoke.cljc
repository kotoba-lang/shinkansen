(ns shinkansen.invoke
  "One invocation shape for every transport, and the seam where authority
  is decided — the increment that makes the five axes orthogonal
  (SPEC §1.5, 2026-09-16).

  Before this namespace, shinkansen answered four of the five questions a
  request raises and conflated the fifth with the first:

    who   principal    nobody — no DID anywhere in dispatch or MCP
    what  artifact     the CID (identity, already the centre)
    where origin       {cid}.ipfs.* / {name}.itonami.app (already two Locations)
    may   grant        nobody — `actions/dispatch` validated SHAPE only, and
                       `lake_dispatch` took an event and nothing else, so
                       reaching the binding WAS the authority
    do    effect       the guest's re-frame effects go to the host (ADR D4),
                       but the ONE effect shinkansen itself performs — the
                       chain append — had no name and no gate

  And it spoke three vocabularies for one thing: `shinkansen.actions` calls
  an intent an event, `shinkansen.load` calls a query a load, and the MCP
  tool and the (documented, unbuilt) `POST /dispatch` each encode a dispatch
  in their own body. A URL path is a transport encoding; so is a JSON-RPC
  tool call; so is a CLI argv. The protocol semantic is one envelope:

    {:artifact  \"bafk…\"                 CID — WHAT computation (required)
     :principal \"did:key:z6Mk…\"        DID — WHO asks (optional on the wire,
                                         the authorizer decides if required)
     :grant     <opaque>                 the presented delegation (a Biscuit on
                                         the wire). Opaque here. A grant is an
                                         UPPER BOUND, never authority
                                         (capability-semantics :grant)
     :input     {:kind :query  :params {…}}      ask   — answers a value
                {:kind :action :event  [id …]}   intend — a re-frame event into
                                                 the state chain
                {:kind :event  :source s :frame f} happened — an environment
                                                 fact asserted into the app}

  What the framework does with it, in order, fail-closed at each step:

    check-envelope   the shape, by name (CIDv0 refused, an unknown kind
                     refused, a non-DID principal refused)
    effect-request   the ONE effect this kind asks for, on the artifact's
                     resource — :chain/append, :app/query, :app/assert
    authorize        call the injected `authorize-fn` with
                     {:principal :artifact :grant :effect}. NO authorize-fn
                     is a refusal (`:no-authorizer`), an answer that is not
                     a decision is a refusal (`:authorizer-answer-not-a-
                     decision`) — nil never puns to allow, the way a missing
                     policy became a public database once (kotoba-lang/
                     authority README).
    dispatch / query only after `:ok true`: the existing pure seams
                     (`actions/dispatch`, `load/run-load`) run, and the chain
                     entry records :principal and the authorizer's :receipt —
                     never the grant (capability-semantics
                     :raw-bearer-in-public-car :forbidden).

  What the framework does NOT do: verify a signature, parse a Biscuit, or
  hold a policy. That is `kotoba-lang/authority` (the lattice) and
  `org-biscuitsec`'s `biscuit.kotoba-logic/authorize` (the five-origin join);
  the host binds one of them to `authorize-fn`. Hostname and origin are
  NOT inputs to the decision: an origin is where a computation is
  isolated, not proof of who is asking (SPEC §1.5).
