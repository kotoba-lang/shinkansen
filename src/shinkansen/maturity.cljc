(ns shinkansen.maturity
  "Where shinkansen stands against Next.js / SvelteKit (the meta-framework
  face) and shadcn / Radix (the component face), as DATA with a measured
  column — rewritten 2026-09-16 after the map had gone stale (g0–g3 still
  said 'no route tree yet' while routes.cljc had shipped).

  The distinction this map is for: DECLARED vs DRIVEN. A namespace with a
  contract and tests but no host that calls it is declared; one a running
  host or a product calls is driven. Measured 2026-09-16 over cloud-kotoba /
  net-kotobase / cloud-itonami-app / cloud-kotoba-dds (grep of
  `[shinkansen.<ns>` require forms): 5 namespaces had consumers
  (interaction 10, theme 6, audit 6, viewport 3, coscientist 1) and eleven
  had none. The reference host (shinkansen.host + shinkansen.serve, the
  reference app, host-node-check) turned 'declared' into 'driven by the
  framework's own host'; later the same day kotoba.cloud (cloud-kotoba/
  app-kotoba-cloud) became the product consumer of routes / adapter /
  invoke / state identity — the map says which is which, and :consumers
  counts products, not the framework's own host.

  Status vocabulary (one of):
    :driven-by-product   a deployed product requires it (count in :consumers)
    :driven-by-host      the reference host runs it end to end (host-node-check)
    :declared            contract + tests, nobody calls it
    :absent              nothing
    :not-by-design       deliberately not built; the reason is in :why
    :unique              the comparison frameworks have no counterpart

  Every :ns named here must exist — maturity-test pins that, so this map
  cannot drift to naming namespaces that were renamed away.")
