  "Framework default for multi-screen-size documents.

  A shinkansen document is ONE self-contained file addressed by CID — it
  must render correctly on the phones, tablets and desktops that fetch it
  from a gateway, without knowing which one is asking. This namespace is
  the pure contract for that:

    1. :meta — the viewport meta tag every published document MUST carry
       (its absence is checked at publish time; a document without it is
       not responsive by definition).
    2. :breakpoints — the framework-default width bands. Apps may extend
       the list; they must not shrink it (a document that only has a
       desktop layout fails the :document contract on mobile).
    3. audit — a pure, static check over the emitted HTML: the viewport
       meta is present and the document's inline CSS covers the smallest
       band. Fail-closed: problems come back as {:ok false :problems ...}
       with the reason named, never a throw.

  Pure .cljc (dual-render per shitsuke). No js/. Static analysis only —
  this cannot verify real rendering; it verifies the CONTRACT markers the
  host renderer and the framework rely on."
