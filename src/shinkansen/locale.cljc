  "Cookie-based, path-independent locale negotiation — the framework default.

  Owner decision (measured live on app-kotoba.cloud): locale selection by
  URL path (`/ja/about`) creates dead links and IA fragmentation — 22
  locales × path copies per page. The shinkansen default is instead:

    one document per language-agnostic route; the locale is negotiated
    by cookie (with Accept-Language fallback); the language switch
    writes the cookie client-side.

  This matches the content-addressed document model: each locale variant
  of a document is still its own CID (identity is content), but the ENTRY
  route never forks per locale — the host/edge negotiates. This namespace
  is the pure contract for that negotiation; apps must not re-derive it
  (app-kotoba.cloud's kb_locale cookie + /js/language-selector.js is the
  same pattern this replaces with a framework default).

  Pure .cljc, no js/ (dual-render per shitsuke). Fail-closed: a cookie
  value outside :supported is never trusted."
