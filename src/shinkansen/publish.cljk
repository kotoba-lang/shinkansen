  "View/document → CID publishing (the identity half of shinkansen).

  The actual two-plane publish is `scripts/publish-document.cljk` in the
  com-junkawasaki root (archive = kotobase.net PUT /ipfs/{cid} → B2;
  origin = R2 ipld/{cid} in kotobase-graph-database-production). This
  namespace is the structured front of that path: it builds the manifest
  the publish script consumes and interprets its verdict, fail-closed.

  A shinkansen document is ONE file (ADR-2609092600 :document rule): the
  view HTML that a shitsuke guest produced, self-contained. A document
  that fetches its own assets from the CDN cannot claim a CID and this
  namespace refuses to manifest one — that refusal is the whole point of
  the :document contract."
