(ns shinkansen.serve
  "The node:http transport for `shinkansen.host` — and the dev loop
  (maturity axis F, which had a contract and no server).

  Bytes in → `host/handle` → bytes out. Two things live here that the pure
  host cannot own:

    the reload stream   GET /__shinkansen/reload is a text/event-stream;
                        every open client gets `reload` when the ctx is
                        swapped. `host/reload-script` (injected only when
                        :dev? is set) listens and calls location.reload().
    the watch           `fs.watch` over :watch dirs, debounced; on change
                        `rebuild-fn` runs and must answer {:ok true :ctx …}
                        or {:ok false :problems …}. A failed rebuild keeps
                        the LAST GOOD ctx serving and routes every GET to an
                        error document naming the problems (dev.cljc:
                        error-as-content, never a silent 500). The stream
                        fires either way, so the browser shows the error.

  Every save is a new snapshot — a new head to look at — which is why
  live-reload is the whole HMR story here (SPEC §2.5): there is no module
  to hot-swap, only a new document CID.

  Run programmatically: (start {:ctx … :port 0 :watch [\"src\"] :rebuild-fn f})
  → a promise of {:server :port :stop :swap!}."

;; A document's ETag is the CID of its bytes, so once the host has answered a
;; URL the answer is a value: the bytes, the headers, the 304. The table
;; keeps that value per URL in the transport's own terms (a Buffer, a flat
;; header array) so a repeat request does no Clojure work beyond a Map
;; lookup — for :static. An :ssr entry re-runs its load-fn with the same
;; params and answers from the table only when the data is `=` to the data
;; the bytes were rendered from (host/response-plan); anything else — a
;; different value, a throwing load — goes to `host/handle`, which answers
;; and refreshes the entry. Swapping the ctx empties the table.
