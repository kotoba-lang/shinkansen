(ns shinkansen.actions
  "Declared mutations — the mutations increment (maturity axis C).

  A form POST or an agent dispatch is the SAME thing: an event into the
  state chain (shinkansen.state). This namespace turns declared events
  into a dispatch surface the browser and an MCP agent both use:

    {:events {:cart/add {:validate (fn [event] …)}}}

  → {:kind :action :event [::cart/add {:id x}]}   (a shinkansen.invoke envelope)
     → authorize (invoke) → validate → state/chain-entry
     → {:ok true :db-cid … :height …}

  Fail-closed: an undeclared event, or one failing its :validate fn, is
  refused BY NAME before any chain entry is built. The response carries
  the new db CID so the caller (browser or agent) can verify and follow
  the chain — one surface, both clients.

  This namespace is the POST-authorization step. It validates shape and
  declaration, not authority: a binding (HTTP route, MCP tool, CLI) must
  reach it through `shinkansen.invoke/dispatch`, which decides
  {:principal :artifact :grant :effect} first and refuses without an
  authorizer. Calling this directly from a binding is the hazard SPEC
  §1.5 names — reaching the binding becomes the authority.

  Pure .cljc. The host owns the HTTP binding and persistence; this owns
  the declaration → validation → chain-entry seam."
