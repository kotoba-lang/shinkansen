  "The UI/UX document contract as a deterministic fitness function.

  A shinkansen document is fetched by phones, tablets, desktops, screen
  readers and agents that know nothing about each other. This namespace
  scores ONE emitted document (HTML + inline CSS) against the contract a
  person needs to find their next action on it — and names every miss
  with WHY it matters, so the fix is obvious and the kaizen delta can be
  re-measured. It is the judge of `shinkansen.coscientist`; the loop is
  only as honest as this function, so every axis was seeded from a
  failure measured on a live page (kotoba.cloud/account, 2026-09-15) and
  every axis has a test that shows it both passing and failing.

  Axes (each yields score 0..1, weight, finding-with-why):

    :viewport          device-width meta + a phone band     (shinkansen.viewport)
    :assets-resolve    every same-origin script/stylesheet the document
                       references exists in the published asset set — a
                       document whose script 404s never hydrates, and
                       every 'loading…' cell becomes a permanent lie
    :unique-ids        no duplicate id= — getElementById binds the first
                       only, so every later control with that id is dead
    :nav-one-home      one nav entry per destination, one data-current
    :nav-before-content on the phone band a long nav precedes the content;
                       > 8 nav links before <main> means screens of nav
    :skip-link         a nav before <main> needs a[href=#main]
    :idle-pending      the idle document shows at most ONE pending-state
                       region — twelve 'loading…' cells is fabricated
                       progress, not readiness
    :idle-disabled     a disabled control in the idle document carries no
                       reason a person can act on
    :repeated-actions  the same visible action label 3+ times — one fact,
                       one home
    :plain-labels      headings/labels in task language — no parenthesised
                       protocol lists, no ALL-CAPS field names
    :note-density      explanatory paragraphs on the idle screen
    :locale-path-links hrefs that fork by locale path (/ja/…) — the host
                       negotiates by cookie (shinkansen.locale)
    :fixed-anchor      a position:fixed rule without an inline anchor
                       floats at its static position (a dead gutter)
    :links-resolve     every same-origin <a href> path resolves to a
                       published document or a declared route — the nav
                       that links /docs/ when no /docs/ was emitted is a
                       404 the framework itself wrote (measured 2026-09-15)
    :csp-allows-assets the response's Content-Security-Policy lets the
                       document's own same-origin stylesheet/script/image load —
                       abc2c4f moved CSS to /css/site.css under a CSP of
                       style-src 'unsafe-inline' and every page shipped
                       unstyled while the bytes audited at 100
    :pre-overflow      a document with <pre> needs a rule that lets code
                       blocks scroll (overflow(-x): auto|scroll) — on the
                       phone band they clip mid-line otherwise
    :code-language     every visible <pre> names its language (data-lang
                       on the pre, or <code class=\"language-…\"> inside) —
                       a block that names none is one colour with nothing
                       to tokenize or announce; measured 2026-09-15 on
                       kotoba.cloud/docs: the code area was unreadable
    :shell             the document wears the app shell the host declares
                       (ctx :shell :app): one nav[data-chrome=rail] AFTER
                       <main> in document order and a data-chrome=top bar —
                       the structure cloud-kotoba-dds.shell/document emits.
                       Every other axis here measures the chrome a document
                       DECLARES; none measured that it declared any, so a
                       page that dropped the shell (the marketing header
                       alone, no rail) scored 97–100 on kotoba.cloud
                       (measured 2026-09-17: the apex, support, the blog,
                       legal, 11 catalog pages). No :shell in ctx is
                       :not-applicable — a host that has no shell contract
                       is not judged against one
    :chrome-layers     chrome the document DECLARES keeps its layer: an
                       element marked data-chrome=top (a console top bar)
                       has a position:sticky|fixed rule with a block
                       anchor, one marked data-chrome=float (a popover
                       menu) has position:absolute|fixed with a z-index —
                       measured 2026-09-15: the top bar scrolled away with
                       the content and the account menu opened IN FLOW,
                       pushing the sidebar apart instead of floating over it
    :actions-declared  every `data-action` a control names is an event the
                       shinkansen.actions declaration (ctx :actions)
                       declares — the browser and the agent share one
                       dispatch vocabulary, so a control naming an
                       undeclared id is a dead control the surface would
                       refuse by name (shinkansen.interaction, 2026-09-16)
    :behaviors-delivered every data-behavior marker (jp-go-dds.behavior:
                       dialog / menu / tabs / disclosure / radiogroup /
                       toast / combobox) is selected by a shipped script
                       AND its subtree carries the markup the contract
                       lists — markup without its runtime, or a runtime
                       with markup it cannot find, is a dead control that
                       no class change reveals (2026-09-16)
    :classes-styled    the class names the document puts on its elements
                       are addressed by a rule in the CSS it ships (inline
                       <style> or a supplied same-origin stylesheet) — a
                       page whose header, nav and footer classes have no
                       rule renders as bare links with the skip link in
                       view, while every marker axis above stays green;
                       measured 2026-09-16 on docs.kotoba.cloud/graph/:
                       27 of 54 classes unstyled, audit 98.3 / 100. A
                       few rule-less hook classes are normal (a fifth is
                       tolerated); half the document is a stylesheet that
                       was not shipped

  Fail-closed: an axis that CANNOT be measured (no asset set supplied for
  :assets-resolve) is reported under :unmeasured and excluded from the
  score — it is never a silent pass. A document may carry its own :ctx
  (merged over the shared one) when several hosts share one emit tree —
  the documents/routes a docs-host page can link to are not the apex's. Pure .cljc, no js/, static analysis
  only: it verifies contract MARKERS in the emitted document, not pixels.
  Visibility is structural (hidden= attribute, closed <details>) — what a
  browser hides by default the idle-state axes do not count."
